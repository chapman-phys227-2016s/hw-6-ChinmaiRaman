# PHYS227 HW 6

**Author:** Chinmai Raman_

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys227-2016s/hw-6-ChinmaiRaman.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys227-2016s/hw-6-ChinmaiRaman)

**Due date:** 2016/03/17

## Specification

**Hints:** For tests involving plots, use your Jupyter notebook instead of the nosetests framework. Solve each problem in two ways: 1) with numpy numerically, and 2) with sympy symbolically.

Complete the following exercises from the primary textbook, placing your solutions into separate files. In each file, write the solution as a callable function, so that you can write suitable test functions that demonstrate correct output using the nose framework. GitHub will automatically run your tests on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework with build status above.

1. Exercise C.3 (```yx_ODE.py```)
1. Exercise C.4 (```unstable_ODE.py```) 

Finally, to cleanly present your work, create a Jupyter notebook ```hw6.ipynb``` that imports each of your python files as modules and demonstrates the functionality. The notebook should be formatted professionally using Markdown headings, including your name and a brief description of each homework section.

## Assessment

The problems were simple, and the second one was interesting.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

Chinmai Raman
